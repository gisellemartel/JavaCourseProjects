This is the final project completed for Object-Oriented Programming II. The
purpose of this assignment was to build a course registration command line app.
The program can read an input file containing all available courses and their requirements,
and also several input files containing the requested courses by a "student", and
a list of completed courses. The program will then determine if registration may
take place with the information read from the input files. The program uses a
a linked list to implement the system. There is also a feature which allows
the user to test the various methods available in this program.
